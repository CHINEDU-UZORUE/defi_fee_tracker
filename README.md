# Solana DeFi Protocols: Fees & Revenue Tracking

This project tracks and analyzes fees and revenue generated by Solana-based DeFi protocols. It sources blockchain data via the CoinGecko API for token prices, Helius RPC API for token holders data, and DefiLlama API for fees and revenue data. The workflow includes data collection, analysis, and an interactive dashboard.

**Note:** To reproduce the app, users need a Helius API key and a paid CoinGecko API key.

## Project Structure

- **02_data_collection.ipynb**: Collects protocol fee and revenue data from Solana blockchain and related APIs.
- **03_data_analysis.ipynb**: Analyzes trends, visualizes metrics, and generates insights from the collected data.
- **app.py**: Runs a web app for interactive exploration of protocol performance and revenue statistics.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory.
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run notebooks**:
    - Open `02_data_collection.ipynb` to fetch and store Solana DeFi data.
    - Open `03_data_analysis.ipynb` to analyze and visualize protocol metrics.
4. **Launch the dashboard**:
    ```bash
    python streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

- Use the notebooks for step-by-step data gathering and analysis.
- Use the app for interactive visualization and protocol comparison.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)
